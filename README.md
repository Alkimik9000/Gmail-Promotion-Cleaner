# Gmail Promotions Cleaner

This project provides a script that automates deleting promotional email in Gmail. It scans the Promotions category, collects unique senders, creates filters that automatically trash future mail from those senders, and deletes existing messages.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Google Cloud project with the Gmail API enabled
- OAuth credentials file (`credentials.json`)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/Alkimik9000/Gmail-Promotion-Cleaner)
   cd gmail-promotions-cleaner
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust paths or scopes if needed. Place your `credentials.json` in the project root.

## Usage
Run the script from the project directory:
```bash
python main.py
```
On first run a browser will open for OAuth authentication. A `token.json` file is created to store the refresh token for subsequent runs.

## Configuration
`config.py` defines `MAX_SENDERS` â€“ the maximum number of unique senders to process. Gmail allows up to 1000 filters, so keep this number at or below that limit.

## Warnings
- **Data loss**: deleted messages go to Trash and will be permanently removed after 30 days. Test on a small set or a non-primary account.
- **Filter limit**: Gmail has a limit of ~1000 filters. The script stops once it has created filters for `MAX_SENDERS` senders.
